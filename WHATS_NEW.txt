- 3D filtering: faster way using object properties.
- Segmentation: fixed value threshold option added.
- Plaque distances: In case that there is no plaque (object<10000px), use central pixel.

- Neuropil mask: - The area of neuropil was the oposite. Now it is fixed.
		 - New output: Object density in mm3 (depending of the resolution, asked at the begining).
- Plaque distances: - Neuropil marsk is applyed to all the channels.
        - Areas of each bin are calculated according to Neuropil mask + plaque Mask.
